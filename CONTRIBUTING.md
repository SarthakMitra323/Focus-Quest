## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

#### JavaScript
- Use ES6+ features (const, let, arrow functions, etc.)
- Follow consistent naming conventions:
  - `camelCase` for variables and functions
  - `PascalCase` for classes and constants
  - `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for global constants
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Use meaningful variable names

```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good
function calculateQuestProgress(questsCompleted, totalQuests) {
    const progress = (questsCompleted / totalQuests) * 100;
    return Math.min(progress, 100);
}

// ‚ùå Avoid
function calc(q, t) {
    return (q / t) * 100;
}
```

#### CSS
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for colors and spacing
- Follow BEM naming convention where appropriate
- Keep selectors specific but not overly nested
- Group related properties together
- Mobile-first responsive design

```css
/* ‚úÖ Good */
.card {
    background: var(--color-surface);
    padding: var(--space-xl);
    border-radius: var(--radius-lg);
}

/* ‚ùå Avoid */
.card {
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9);
    padding: 32px;
    border-radius: 12px;
}
```

#### HTML
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Include proper ARIA labels for accessibility
- Keep markup clean and well-indented
- Use meaningful IDs and classes

```html
<!-- ‚úÖ Good -->
<section class="card quest-form" id="questForm">
    <h2 class="card-title">üìú New Quest</h2>
    <form id="newQuestForm">
        <label for="taskTitle">Quest Title *</label>
        <input type="text" id="taskTitle" required>
    </form>

    <div class="title">New Quest</div>
    <input type="text">
</div>
```

## üé® Adding New Journeys

Want to add a new journey theme? Here's how:

### 1. Define the Journey

Edit `script.js` and add to the `JOURNEYS` object:

```javascript
const JOURNEYS = {
    // ... existing journeys
    forest: {
        name: 'Enchanted Forest',
        emoji: 'üå≥',
        milestones: [
            { percent: 0, message: 'Enter the mystical forest!' },
            { percent: 25, message: 'Discovering hidden paths...' },
            { percent: 50, message: 'Halfway through the woods!' },
            { percent: 75, message: 'The ancient tree beckons!' },
            { percent: 100, message: 'üå≤ Forest conquered!' }
        ]
    }
};
```

### 2. Add UI Button

Edit `index.html` in the journey selection section:

```html
<div class="journey-selector">
    <!-- existing buttons -->
    <button class="journey-btn" data-journey="forest">üå≥ Enchanted Forest</button>
</div>
```

### 3. Add Progress State

The state will automatically handle the new journey, but you can initialize it in `script.js`:

```javascript
let state = {
    // ...
    progress: {
        mountain: 0,
        star: 0,
        sea: 0,
        forest: 0  // Add your journey
    },
    // ...
};
```

### 4. Test
- Select the new journey
- Complete quests and verify progress
- Check milestone messages
- Verify localStorage persistence

---

## üèÜ Adding New Achievements

### 1. Define the Achievement

Add to `ACHIEVEMENT_DEFINITIONS` in `script.js`:

```javascript
{
    id: 'early_bird',
    title: 'Early Bird',
    description: 'Complete a quest before 8 AM',
    icon: 'üåÖ',
    check: (state) => {
        return state.quests.some(q => {
            const hour = new Date(q.completedAt).getHours();
            return hour < 8;
        });
    }
}
```

### 2. Test the Achievement

- Trigger the unlock condition
- Verify the toast notification appears
- Check that confetti launches
- Ensure it persists in localStorage
- Verify it shows in the achievements grid
